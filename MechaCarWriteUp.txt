#MPG regression:

* The correlation matrix showed moderate correlation of mpg with vehicle_lenght r = 0.61. For vehicle_lenght Pr(>|t|) is 3.03*10^-12 so the null hypothesis Ho is excluded. 
There is also weak correlation of mpg with ground_clearance r=0.33 with Pr(>|t|) =2.13*10^-8, also non random variance. 
Other parameters show either none or very weak correlation thus I did not included them into the model.
* The slope mpg(vehicle_lenght) is non zero with r^2 = 0.67


#Suspension Coil Summary
*The statistics of whole population is in a table “Statistics_psi”. 
Mean of whole population is 1498.78 and median = 1500, with variance = 62.29 and standard deviation = 7.89. 
In the first glance everything is within spec: variance 100. However, 
when data is grouped by lot (table Statistics_psi_per_lot) then Lot3 has variance out of spec = 170.29, 
which probably is the contributor for underperformance of part of the vehicle fleet.  


#Suspension coil T-Test
*Conducting paired t-test to determine potential difference between lots 1,2,3. Paired t-test is possible becaseu sample count in Lots1,2,3 is the same , 50.
Paired t-test showed for lot1 vs lot3 p=0.0437 and for lot2 vs lot-3 p=0.04199, Ho for both tests is rejected 
i.e. mean of lot 3 statistically is different than lot 1 and lot2. The sanity test, t-test for lot 1 vs lot 2 produced p= 0.6052, not rejecting Ho true difference of is equal to 0


#Design own test

“If the quality is right, everything is right”. 
*One of the key factors showing that MechaCar outperforms the competition is the reliability of car components. 
There are few items to focus: breaks,  engine, battery lifetime. We can conduct Weibull analysis on reliability of those components. 
By knowing the number of failures and estimate of the population we can calculate the average lifetime and probability of failure of the components, 
and set it against the competitor.  We can collect distribution of the lifetime of parts, e.g. breaks from MechaCar and competition and conduct t-test to compare the mean lifetime. 
If MechaCar lifetime of the component is longer than competitor, that can be used as a factor to promote MechaCar.
